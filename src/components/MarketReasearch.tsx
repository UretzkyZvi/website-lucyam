            Jobs are anticipated to be in high demand with 97 million
            specialists needed in the AI industry by 2025. There are currently
            around 150,000 machine learning engineers that are working in the AI
            field.

            Whilst they have the skills to code and build AI, they sometimes
            lack the solution-based context to understand the opportunities and
            use cases to apply to applications. With Lucy AM we will enable over
            half a billion domain experts that have the professional based
            solutions for their field, but lack the skills to code and actually
            build AI models themselves.

          <p className="mt-2 text-lg ">
            There are currently quite a few no code AI tools in the market.
            Whilst they are able to create AI models for specific use cases,
            they lack the depth and complexity to customize further. Using Lucy
            AM and without any prior experience required to start on your AI
            journey, it's also possible to go deeper and to customize beyond a
            simple use, for instance by combining different types of AI models
            ranging from LLMâ€™S to computer vision and other AI types.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2 text-lg ">
            The AI field is currently a jungle with projects going on around the
            world with different companies and people. With Lucy AM, we
            facilitate the search and collaboration so you can actually find
            existing open source and free AI models that are specific to your
            field and also work together with like minded individuals or with
            people within your company to collaborate and build your own AI
            projects.
